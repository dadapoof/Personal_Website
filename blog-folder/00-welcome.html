				<span style="font-size: 18px">Welcome to my <code>blog!</code> Wow. Took me a while to get this set up, but we are finally here. Reasons why I decided to create this blog:</span><br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">1.</span> <mark>I like to write.</mark> Despite my horrendous style of writing, I actually enjoy tapping furiously on keys to produce coherrent sentences and have other people read them. Bare with me.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">2.</span> I can now <mark>express my thoughts and opinions</mark> about both CS and non-CS related topics! I've been wanting a place to talk about coding and regular news, and what better way to do that than by creating a blog.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">3.</span> I can now finally say: "Oh, I wrote an article about that in my blog". <code>Coolness level:</code> Off the charts.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">4.</span> <mark>What the hell.</mark> Life's short. Might as well record it somehow.<br></br><br></br>

				<span style="font-size: 18px">What you can expect from the blog and what I'll be writing about:</span><br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">1.</span> <mark>Computer Science Related Topics.</mark> This will range from <code>opinion pieces</code> on what is happening in the media, to opinion pieces on technologies, to tutorials on CS stuff.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">2.</span> <mark>Non-Computer Science Related Topics.</mark> Basically, everything else.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">3.</span> Short Stories And Things Like That. I want to start writing stories that are most likely going to be fiction.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">4.</span> <mark>Personal Life.</mark> Updates on my personal life, my career, and my goals for the future!<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">5.</span> Travel Experiences. This one is self explanatory.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">6.</span> Life Experiences. <code>Advice</code> for others based on what I've experienced.<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">7.</span> Reviews Of Products Or Books/Movies. I really like reading books and I would love to do a couple of reviews!<br></br>
				<span style="font-size: 18px">8.</span> <mark>So Much More.</mark> Literally, anything that comes to mind!<br></br><br></br>

				So make sure to check out the rest of my articles! I try to create wholesome content while keeping myself amused.
				I plan on writing one article a week and hopefully I will be able to keep that up for a while. In the meantime, <a href="mailto:damassart@aol.com">Email me</a> with any questions, concerns, or comments! I'd love to chat with almost anyone...<br><br>
