				I had my first real taste of Computer Science in 7th grade when I attended a Summer Tech Camp near my hometown. I was creating a very basic website, using HTML, for my soccer team and thatâ€™s how I decided I loved Computer Science. <br></br>In high school, I was one of the founding members of the sole Coding Club. Our club advisor briefly taught us a new language every year and the basics of code. I admit, I don't remember much about most of these languages, but the projects I created with this club are memorable. I worked with HTML, Swift, Javascript, and CSS. We worked on projects such as: an analog clock, battleship, and the beginning of a fantasy soccer app. <br></br>Sadly, despite being in this club for my four years of highschool, I still thought I wanted to become a Biology major in college and do Bio-med. However, coding followed me everywhere: in 11th grade, I taught myself enough Python to be chosen as a teaching assistant in an 8th grade beginner coding class. For 4-5 months, I worked closely with the professor (who was also my math professor) to teach a class of 30 students how to program in Python. Moreover, I worked closely with a French speaking student who needed the whole class to be translated to him. <br></br>However, it was only when I took my first Computer Science course in college that I decided to major in it. During my first semester at Tufts University, I am taking Comp 11, an introduction to C++. After one month of Comp 11, I am already able to create games like Mastermind, the dice game called Pig, Hangman, and the famous game 2048. Moreover, I am enrolled in the next CS course next semester, COMP15 where we learn about data structures and algorithms. I am very excited to put my C++ code to use and expand my skills to other coding languages. Finally, I am constantly seeking to create projects with the new knowledge I aquire. This personal website is an example of that!
