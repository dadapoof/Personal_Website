				I had my first real taste of Computer Science in 7th grade when I attended a Summer Tech Camp near my hometown. I was creating a very basic website, using HTML, for my soccer team and thatâ€™s how my romantic love story with CS began. <br></br>In high school, I was one of the founding members of my school's sole and first Coding Club. Yes, you could say I was awesome. Our club advisor briefly taught us a new language every year and the basics of code. To be completely honest, I don't remember much about most of these languages, but the projects I created with this club are memorable. I worked with HTML, Swift, Javascript, and CSS. We worked on projects such as: an analog clock, battleship, and the beginning of a fantasy soccer app. <br></br>Sadly, despite being in this club for my four years of highschool, I still thought I wanted to become a Biology major in college and do Pre-Med. However, coding followed me everywhere: in 11th grade, I taught myself enough Python to be chosen as a teaching assistant in an 8th grade beginner coding class. For 4-5 months, I worked with the professor (who was also my math professor) to teach a class of 30 students how to program in Python. I spent most of my time working closely with a French speaking student who needed the whole class to be translated to him. A difficulty arose when I had to explain to him what a loop was in French. To this day, I still don't know if there is a Stack Overflow for French speakers (but I was able to explain what a loop was to the student).<br></br>However, it was only when I took my first Computer Science course in college that I discovered common sense and decided to major in it. During my first semester at Tufts University, I took Comp 11, an introduction to C++. I was  able to create games like Mastermind, the dice game called Pig, Hangman, and the famous game 2048. Moreover, I am currently taking the next CS course, COMP15 where I am learning about data structures, BIG O space and time complexity, and algorithms. I am very excited to put my C++ code to use and expand my skills to other coding languages. Finally, I am constantly seeking to create projects with the new knowledge I aquire. This personal website is an example of that!
